            <strong>1. General Information</strong><br><br>
            The protection of your personal data is of great importance to us. This privacy policy informs you about which personal data is collected, processed, and stored when using our app, as well as your rights as a data subject.<br><br>
            
            <strong>2. Purpose of the App and Data Collection</strong><br><br>
            Our app allows users to scan insurance documents using the camera and have them automatically translated. The use of the camera is necessary to capture documents, which are then processed and stored via a backend in the AWS Cloud. Translations are carried out using the ChatGPT API, and the documents are stored in an AWS database and in AWS S3 buckets.<br><br>
            
            <strong>3. Collection and Processing of Personal Data</strong><br><br>
            a. Camera Access<br>
            The app requires access to the camera to scan documents. This access is used solely for the purpose of capturing the document and sending it to our backend for further processing.<br><br>
            
            b. Processing by the Django Backend on AWS<br>
            The scanned documents are sent to our Django backend, which runs on AWS servers in Docker containers. The data is processed there to enable translation.<br><br>
            
            c. Storage in AWS Databases and S3 Buckets<br>
            The scanned documents and their translations are stored in our AWS database. Additionally, the translated documents are stored in AWS S3 buckets to provide users with access to the translated documents. This storage is maintained indefinitely or until the user requests data deletion.<br><br>
            
            d. Transmission to the ChatGPT API<br>
            The scanned documents are transmitted to the ChatGPT API for translation. The data is used solely for the purpose of translation and then sent back to our backend. We have no control over data processing by the ChatGPT API, which is an external service.<br><br>
            
            e. Local Storage<br>
            In addition to storage on our servers, users are offered the option to save the translated documents locally on their device as PDF files.<br><br>
            
            <strong>4. Data Disclosure</strong><br><br>
            The collected data is not disclosed to third parties, except for processing by the ChatGPT API and storage in the AWS Cloud. The data is processed exclusively for the purpose described above and is not used for advertising or analysis purposes.<br><br>
            
            <strong>5. Your Rights as a Data Subject</strong><br><br>
            You have the right to:<br><br>
            Access: Receive information about the personal data we process.<br>
            Rectification: Have incorrect data corrected.<br>
            Erasure: Request the deletion of your data stored with us if it is no longer needed.<br>
            Objection: Object to the processing of your data.<br>
            You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided above.<br><br>
            
            <strong>6. Data Security</strong><br><br>
            We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or destruction. Data processing is carried out via encrypted connections (e.g., SSL/TLS).<br><br>
            
            <strong>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>
            We reserve the right to update this privacy policy to comply with legal requirements or to reflect changes in our app's functionality.<br><br>
